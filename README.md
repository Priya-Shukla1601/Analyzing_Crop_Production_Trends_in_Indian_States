**Analyzing Crop Production Trends in Indian State**
This repository contains my complete data analysis project focused on understanding crop production patterns across Indian states using real-world agricultural data.

Through this project, I performed end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, key factors influencing yield, state-wise comparisons, and relationships between variables such as crop type, season, and production quantity.

 **What I Did in This Project**

- Cleaned, prepared, and structured the dataset for analysis.

- Performed detailed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate EDA.

- Identified patterns in crop yields, seasonal behaviors, and state-level differences.

- Visualized insights using matplotlib and seaborn (heatmaps, bar charts, trend plots, etc.).

- Highlighted meaningful findings that can help in policy decisions, agricultural planning, and resource allocation.

 **Repository Includes**

- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with full code and explanations

- All visualizations generated during EDA

- Insight summaries and interpretations

 **Objective**

To analyze agricultural production data and extract insights that support data-driven improvements in farming efficiency, crop planning, and agricultural policy development.
